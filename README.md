# Shift
Shift is a new cryptocurrency, it was launched in August 2015 by a restricted team of passionate crypto-enthusiasts. It is based on the promising Ethereum technology (currently the 2nd most valued cryptocurrency in the World after Bitcoin) and aims to provide its own ecosystem thanks to a different vision. Over the months, and after various events in the life of a young product such as a cryptocurrency, Shift is now moving to a bright future thanks to an ever growing team of talented people.  Shift’s funding is done via an operation called premine. All of the funds are secured and distributed over a long period of time to ensure long term development. How is that done?  Shift is a sophisticated cryptocurrency that allows the creation of what is called a DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which is like a virtual organization that lives on the Blockchain. Everything in that organization is written by contract, and that contract is only executed if certain conditions are met. What is the blockchain?  The blockchain is a kind of database shared between all people around the world, inherited from bitcoin technology. Shift’s blockchain is amongst the most advanced type of blockchain.
